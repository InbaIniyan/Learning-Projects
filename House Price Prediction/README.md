# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to develop a regression model capable of accurately estimating house prices based on various features. The project encompasses critical stages such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and thorough evaluation.

## Steps

### 1. Importing Libraries

Essential libraries are imported to facilitate data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks. These include `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `train_test_split`, `LinearRegression`, and `mean_squared_error`.

### 2. Load Dataset

The dataset, 'house_price_prediction.csv', is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame (`df`), serving as the foundation for subsequent analysis and model training.

### 3. EDA on the Dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves a comprehensive examination of the dataset. This includes analyzing summary statistics, creating visualizations like correlation matrices, distribution plots, pair plots, and more to gain profound insights into the data's characteristics and relationships.

### 4. Model Building

#### Data Preprocessing
- Features (`X`) and the target variable (`y`) are defined, ensuring a clear distinction between input features and the variable to predict.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` to facilitate model training and evaluation.
- A Linear Regression model is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in regression tasks, and it is trained on the training set.

#### Model Evaluation
- Predictions are made on the test set, and performance metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are calculated to assess the model's accuracy.

### 5. Model Testing

The trained model is put to the test, visualizing its predictions against actual prices using scatter plots. The R-squared score, a measure of the model's goodness of fit, is calculated to further evaluate its performance.

### 6. Output Presentation

#### a) Feature Importance
- The significance of each feature in predicting the target variable is visualized through a bar plot. This provides valuable insights into which features play a crucial role in determining house prices.

#### e) Feature Engineering Insights
- The impact of feature engineering, such as creating a new feature 'total_rooms', on model performance is evaluated. This step explores how additional features can enhance predictive power.

  ```

#### f) Outlier Analysis
- A box plot is generated to visualize the distribution of house prices. Outliers are identified and removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, and the model is re-evaluated without outliers.
