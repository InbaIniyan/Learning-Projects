# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview

This machine learning project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health-related features. Leveraging a dataset containing crucial information about individuals, the project employs machine learning techniques to build a robust model capable of accurately classifying whether a person is prone to diabetes or not.

## Steps

### 1. Importing Libraries

The project begins by importing essential libraries that play pivotal roles in different stages of the project. The libraries include `pandas` for data manipulation, `numpy` for numerical operations, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization, `sklearn` for machine learning functionalities, and `RandomForestClassifier` for the chosen classification algorithm.

### 2. Load & Explore Dataset

The dataset, stored in 'dataset/diabetes.csv', is loaded using the `pandas` library. An initial exploration of the dataset involves displaying the first few rows, checking for missing values, and obtaining basic statistics. This step provides a foundational understanding of the dataset's structure and characteristics.

### 3. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

#### (i) Histograms for Numerical Features

Numerical features are visually represented through histograms, offering insights into the distribution of each feature within the dataset.

#### (ii) Box Plots for Outlier Detection

Box plots are generated to identify potential outliers in the numerical features. Outlier detection is crucial for understanding the data's variance and potential impact on model performance.

#### (iii) Correlation Matrix

A correlation matrix is created to visualize the relationships between different features. This step helps identify potential multicollinearity and assess feature interdependencies.

#### (iv) Pair Plots (Scatter Matrix)

Pair plots are utilized to explore relationships between selected features. The inclusion of outcome differentiation by color enhances the understanding of feature interactions in relation to the target variable.

#### (v) Pairwise Scatter Plots with the Target Variable

Pair plots with the 'Outcome' variable as the hue provide a comprehensive view of feature relationships concerning the target variable. This aids in identifying patterns and potential predictive features.

### 4. Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves splitting the data into features (X) and the target variable (y). Additionally, standardization is applied to the feature data using the `StandardScaler` from `sklearn`. This step ensures consistent scaling and improves the performance of certain machine learning algorithms.

### 5. Choose a Machine Learning Algorithm

The Random Forest Classifier is selected as the machine learning algorithm for its versatility and effectiveness in handling classification tasks. Its ability to handle complex relationships and provide feature importance makes it suitable for this diabetes prediction project.

### 6. Train the Model

The Random Forest Classifier is trained on the training data, where it learns patterns and relationships from the features to make predictions on unseen data.

### 7. Hyperparameter Tuning

Grid search is employed to find the best hyperparameters for the Random Forest Classifier. Hyperparameter tuning optimizes the model's performance by exploring different combinations of hyperparameter values.

### 8. Model Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on the test data to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report provide a comprehensive understanding of how well the model generalizes to new data.

### 9. Model Assessment

#### (i) Confusion Matrix Heatmap

A heatmap of the confusion matrix visually represents the model's performance in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

#### (ii) ROC Curve

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is plotted to assess the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates at different classification thresholds.

#### (iii) Precision-Recall Curve

The Precision-Recall curve is generated to analyze the precision-recall trade-off. This curve is particularly informative when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

#### (iv) Probability Distribution

Histograms of predicted probabilities for both classes are plotted. This step provides insights into the distribution of model predictions, aiding in understanding the model's confidence in its classifications.
